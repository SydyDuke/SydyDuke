            My name is Sydney Duke, I am an Interior Design student at New Jersey Insitute of Technology.
            <br>I am originally from Orlando, Florida, well truly from Winter Garden but no one knows where that is.
            <br>I love bragging about the fact that my town is part of Walt Disney World, right behind Magic Kingdom.
            <br> I am so close to Magic Kingdom that I can see the castle from my backyard, everyone thinks that this
            <br> is amazing and that you could never complain about something like that but trust me I can. The noise
            <br> that the park creates is super loud, it's a mixture between the fireworks, music, trains, and boats.
            <br> Don't get me wrong I do love living so close to Disney but I just wish that we could block the noise
            <br> from the parks.
